# Agent Finder Specification

**Federated Discovery and Search for Agents**

**Version**: v0.4.2 (Draft)  
**Status**: Proposal  
**Date**: May 5, 2026

## 1\. Overview

LLMs increasingly rely on external capabilities — MCP tools, A2A agents, skills, and other callable services — to extend their functionality. In this document, we refer to these generically as agents or capabilities.

**Agent Finder** is a specification that defines how AI artifacts are cataloged, discovered, and searched across federated networks.

This version (v0.4.2) aligns the discovery framework with the broader ai-catalog standard, shifting towards a media-type-driven approach and mandating standard web protocols (REST) for discovery interfaces to ensure maximum interoperability.

## 2\. Motivation

The prevailing model requires users or developers to explicitly “install” or hardcode each agent before use. As the ecosystem scales to thousands or millions of agents, we need a model where LLMs can discover and invoke agents dynamically, similar to how search engines discover web pages.

Agent descriptions tend to be generic, and most LLMs currently select tools by including all descriptions in the context window — which does not scale. Agent Finder addresses this by moving discovery outside the LLM into a dedicated search service, where richer signals (representative queries, publisher identity, compliance metadata, usage patterns) can be leveraged without consuming context window tokens.

## 3\. Core Design Principles

The Agent Finder protocol is guided by the following core design principles to ensure scalability, interoperability, and ease of adoption:

### 3.1 Search-First Discovery

Rather than requiring users or systems to pre-install agents (analogous to the mobile app store paradigm), Agent Finder promotes a model where agents are discovered dynamically through search. Registries maintain a shared, continuously updated index, making capabilities discoverable the moment they are published.

### 3.2 Scalability Beyond Context Windows

Traditional tool selection relies on injecting all descriptions into the LLM's context window, which does not scale. Agent Finder moves the selection problem outside the LLM into a dedicated search service, leveraging information retrieval techniques to scale to thousands or millions of capabilities without consuming context window tokens.

### 3.3 Artifact Agnostic Envelope

The specification does not define or constrain the internal schema of specific agent types (MCP, A2A, etc.). Instead, it acts as a clean envelope that uses IANA Media Types to identify what an artifact is, delegating the definition of artifact-specific metadata to the respective protocol specifications.

\[\!NOTE\] **IANA Registration Status**: The media types application/a2a-agent-card+json and application/mcp-server+json used in this specification are de-facto community standards tracking towards formal registration. Implementers should note that while well-known path directories (like /.well-known/agent-card.json) are officially registered permanent entries, full media type registrations are pending working group joint submission. Omission of strict verification by intermediaries is recommended during this transition.

### 3.4 Strict Value-or-Reference

To ensure safe parsing and predictable behavior in enterprise environments, a catalog entry must contain exactly one of two mutually exclusive keys for its content delivery:

* **url**: A remote reference to the artifact document.  
* **data**: An embedded JSON object containing the full artifact document.

### 3.5 Universal Baseline for Federation

To guarantee that any system can participate in discovery regardless of its execution stack, an Agent Registry **MUST** expose a standard HTTP REST search interface. While specialized protocols may be used for execution, discovery requires a universal baseline that any HTTP client can access.

### 3.6 Separation of Concerns

To maintain a clean and implementable standard, the protocol delegates operational details:

* **Authentication is Delegated**: Agent authentication is handled by the specific artifact protocol, not the discovery layer.  
* **Distribution is Infrastructure**: Mechanisms for physical delivery (OCI, npm, etc.) are left to backend implementation and are not part of the discovery record.

## 4\. The Data Model

The capability manifest (the file publishers host to advertise their agents) is the central data model. This manifest structure builds upon and extends the schema defined by the [ai-catalog](https://github.com/Agent-Card/ai-catalog) specification, introducing specialized discovery attributes (such as domain-anchored URN identifiers, root-level capabilities, and representative queries) to ensure high-performance search and compatibility across the broader agent ecosystem.

### 4.1 The Capability Manifest (ai-catalog.json)

A manifest file hosted at /.well-known/ai-catalog.json lists the available artifacts.

### 4.2 Catalog Entry Object

Each object in the entries array MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| identifier | String | Globally unique logical identifier for discovery. MUST use a domain-anchored URN namespace format (urn:ai:\<publisher\>:\<namespace\>:\<agent-name\>) where \<publisher\> is a verifiable domain name. This guarantees cross-network uniqueness, nomenclature stability, and decentralized trust binding. See [§4.2.1](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/Users/jbu/Development/ai-card/specification/agent-finder.md#421-agent-identifier-identifier-format-and-rationale) for detailed format specifications and architectural rationale. |
| displayName | String | Human-readable name. |
| type | String | Type of the AI artifact. |

Exactly one of the following MUST be present:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| url | String | URL to retrieve the full artifact. |
| data | Object | The complete artifact document inline. |

Optional fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| description | String | Short description. |
| tags | Array | Keywords for filtering. |
| capabilities | Array | Strings representing specific skills or tools (e.g., \["WeatherTool"\]) to enable fast discovery database filtering without full artifact lookup. |
| representativeQueries | Array | Sample natural-language queries (e.g., \["find me a flight booking agent"\]). Used by registries to build semantic vector embeddings for search ranking. SHOULD contain 2–5 examples. |
| version | String | Version of the artifact. |
| updatedAt | String | ISO 8601 timestamp. |
| metadata | Map | Custom metadata key-value pairs. |
| trustManifest | Object | Verifiable identity and trust metadata. |

### 4.2.1 Agent Identifier (identifier) Format and Rationale

The identifier field serves as the primary logical handle for an agent or capability across federated discovery networks. It MUST follow a standardized, domain-anchored URN format complying with IETF RFC 8141:

```
urn:ai:<publisher>:<namespace>:<agent-name>
```

#### Format Structure

* **urn**: Mandatory prefix indicating a Uniform Resource Name.  
* **ai**: The Namespace Identifier (NID), designating the AI artifact and agent discovery ecosystem.  
* **\<publisher\>**: The Namespace Specific String (NSS) root. MUST be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) representing the publisher or host organization (e.g., acme.com, github.com). This domain acts as the organizational trust anchor and MUST be verifiable against the cryptographic workload identity in the trustManifest.  
* **\<namespace\>**: Optional hierarchical segments separated by : (e.g., finance:trading, weather:telemetry). Allows publishers to categorize capabilities by department, team, or product line without altering infrastructure routing.  
* **\<agent-name\>**: Mandatory terminal segment representing the specific, logical short name of the agent or tool (e.g., assistant, pptx-creator).

#### Please see more details at [Architectural Rationale for URN Restriction](#appendix-c:-agent-naming-urn-format)

### 4.3 Host Info Object

Describes the operator of the catalog.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| displayName | String | Human-readable name of the host. |
| identifier | String | Optional. Verifiable identifier (DID or domain). |
| documentationUrl | String | Optional. URL to documentation. |
| logoUrl | String | Optional. URL to logo. |
| trustManifest | Object | Optional. Trust metadata for the host. |

### 4.4 Examples

#### The Solo Developer Path

No complex identity ceremony or cloud account required.

An agent hosted on Hugging Face Spaces (MCP), published in a manifest:

```
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": { "displayName": "Alice's AI Tools" },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:hf.co:alice-dev:weather-agent",
      "displayName": "Weather Agent",
      "type": "application/mcp-server+json",
      "inline": {
        "name": "Weather Agent",
        "description": "Simple weather lookup using open data",
        "tools": [
          {

            "description": "Get current weather for a city",
            "inputSchema": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": { "city": { "type": "string" } },
              "required": ["city"]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A skill hosted on GitHub, published in a manifest:

```

  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": { "displayName": "Alice's AI Tools" },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:github.com:alice-dev:pptx-creator",
      "displayName": "pptx-creator",
      "type": "application/ai-skill",
      "url": "https://github.com/alice-dev/pptx-creator",

    }
  ]
}
```

      "type": "application/ai-skill+md",
      "url": "https://github.com/alice-dev/pptx-creator"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Enterprise Example

Using trustManifest for compliance, published in a manifest.

```
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:acme.com:travel:concierge",
      "displayName": "Travel Concierge",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme.com/travel/concierge.json",
      "description": "AI-powered travel planning",
      "trustManifest": {
        "identity": "spiffe://acme.com/travel/concierge",
        "identityType": "spiffe",
        "attestations": [
          {
            "type": "SPIFFE-X509",
            "uri": "https://acme.com/.well-known/spiffe/jwks",
            "mediaType": "application/json"
          },
          {
            "type": "SOC2-Type2",
            "uri": "https://trust.acme.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
            "mediaType": "application/pdf"
          },
          {
            "type": "GDPR",
            "uri": "https://trust.acme.com/compliance/gdpr",
            "mediaType": "text/html"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.5 Description Vocabulary

Catalog entries MAY use Schema.org vocabulary (or comparable structured schemas) in their descriptive fields. Any Schema.org-based markup used to describe the agent can be leveraged as filter dimensions in the Search API. This allows domain-specific structured metadata (pricing, geographic coverage, supported languages, certifications) to be attached to records and queried against.

## 5\. Identity and Trust

Identity binding, compliance attestations, provenance, and cryptographic signatures are consolidated into the optional trustManifest object, as defined in the ai-catalog specification. This keeps the core entry lightweight for simple use cases while providing a robust hook for enterprise compliance, entirely separate from the artifact's native operational metadata.

### 5.1 The Trust Manifest Object

The trustManifest object sits alongside the artifact content in a catalog entry and contains the following key members:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| identity | String | **Required**. Globally unique cryptographic workload identifier (e.g., a SPIFFE ID, DID, or HTTPS FQDN URI). Decoupled from the entry's discovery identifier. The cryptographic trust domain inside this identity MUST align with the authority domain root embedded in the discovery identifier namespace. |
| identityType | String | Optional. Type hint for the identity URI (e.g., "did", "spiffe", "https"). |
| attestations | Array | Optional. List of Attestation objects providing verifiable claims. |
| provenance | Array | Optional. List of Provenance Link objects recording lineage. |
| signature | String | Optional. Detached JWS signature computed over the Trust Manifest content. |

### 5.2 Attestation Object

Provides verifiable proof of a claim (e.g., compliance certifications).

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| type | String | **Required**. Attestation type (e.g., "SOC2-Type2", "HIPAA-Audit"). |
| uri | String | **Required**. Location of the attestation document. |
| mediaType | String | **Required**. Format of the document (e.g., "application/pdf"). |
| digest | String | Optional. Cryptographic hash for integrity verification. |

### 5.3 Provenance Link Object

Records lineage and source information.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| relation | String | **Required**. Relationship type (e.g., "derivedFrom", "publishedFrom"). |
| sourceId | String | **Required**. Identifier of the source artifact or data. |
| sourceDigest | String | Optional. Digest of the source for verification. |

For full verification procedures (signature checking, key resolution), refer to the core ai-catalog specification.

## 6\. Discovery

The discovery specification supports two operational layers:

1. **Static Discovery**: A decentralized publishing mechanism where developers and enterprises host static JSON manifests.  
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Active, searchable services (Registries) that index static catalogs and expose dynamic search endpoints.

### 6.1 Discovery Mechanisms

Publishers advertise their capability manifests via the following mechanisms:

* **Well-Known URI**: Hosting the manifest at https://{domain}/.well-known/ai-catalog.json.  
* **Agentmap Directive**: Adding an entry in robots.txt (e.g., Agentmap: https://example.com/catalog.json).  
* **HTML Link Tag**: Including \<link rel="ai-catalog" href="..."\> in the \<head\> of a document.  
* **DNS**: Publishing Service Binding records in the DNS that point directly to either a static capability manifest (e.g., \_catalog.\_agents.example.com) or a dynamic Agent Registry search endpoint (e.g., \_search.\_agents.example.com).

### 6.2 Ingestion Pipelines

Agent Registry instances populate their indexes through ingestion pipelines:

* **Web Ingestion (Required)**: Crawling ai-catalog.json files from discovered URIs. All Agent Finder implementations MUST support this.  
* **Additional Pipelines (Optional)**: Registries may support scanning git repositories, npm registries, or OCI registries as indicated by their configuration.

## 7\. The Agent Finder API

An Agent Registry **MUST** expose a standard HTTP REST search interface to guarantee universal federation. The operational base URL for these endpoints is discovered dynamically by identifying catalog entries within the static ai-catalog.json manifest that carry the application/ai-registry+json media type, as defined in §4.1.

### 7.1 Search (POST /search)

Accepts a natural language query with optional structured constraints. Returns catalog entries ranked by relevance.

**Request Schema:**

```
{
  "query": {
    "text": "find me a flight booking agent",
    "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
    "compliance": "hipaa",
    "federation": "referrals"
  },
  "pageSize": 5
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| text | String | Required. Natural language description of the need. |
| type | String | Optional. Filter by artifact type. |
| compliance | String | Optional. Filter by compliance requirement. |
| publisher | String | Optional. Filter by publisher name or identifier. |
| federation | String | Optional. auto (default), referrals, or none. |

**Response Schema:**

The response returns standard catalog entries with additional relevance scores, plus optional referrals. The score parameter denotes **semantic relevance ranking** (0-100) computed by the search registry, indicating how well the entry satisfies the natural language query criteria. It is strictly an informational relevance metric and MUST NOT be interpreted by orchestrators as a cryptographic trust, compliance, or safety rating. Trust evaluation is fully decoupled and handled independently via the verification procedures in the trustManifest layer.

```

    }
  ],
  "pageToken": "eyJwYWdlIjogMn0="
}
```

### 7.1.1 Query Processing and Resolution (Informative)

While this specification mandates the REST interface for interoperability, implementations may employ advanced techniques to resolve natural language queries to specific agent endpoints. An example flow, drawing from research on Agent Naming Services (ANS) and Federated Registries, involves the following steps:

1. **Semantic Translation & Embedding**:  
   * **LLM Query Interpretation**: The Registry uses an LLM to extract specific multi-dimensional requirements from the natural language text field, translating it into structured capability attributes (e.g., domain: travel, skill: flight\_booking, constraints: meal\_preference).  
   * **Vector Embeddings**: The Registry may also convert the query description into a dense vector embedding to understand semantic meaning (e.g., matching "foreign exchange" to "forex" or "international money transfer").  
2. **Global Discovery via Federated Routing**:  
   * Advanced implementations may execute this query against a federated network. For example, using semantic attributes or embedding vectors to perform a search across a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) (e.g., an extended IPFS Kademlia DHT) or by leveraging **DNS-AID** to discover authoritative registries for specific domains.  
   * This maps the semantic capabilities to cryptographic digests or endpoints of agents that possess those skills across the federated network.

### 7.2 List (GET /agents) — Optional

Deterministic browsing, designed for developer portals. Highly cacheable, relies on strict database filtering, and does not support relevance-based sorting.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| filter | String | EBNF filter expression. |
| orderBy | String | Sorting fields (e.g., name, created\_at DESC). |
| pageSize | Integer | Max results (default: 20, max: 100). |
| pageToken | String | Pagination token. |

### 7.3 Protocol Wrappers (Optional)

While the REST API is mandated as the floor for interoperability, a Registry **MAY** additionally expose its search capability natively via an MCP Tool or an A2A Skill to preserve native orchestrator flows.

The return response from these protocol-specific wrappers **MUST** follow the same catalog entry format as defined in this specification. However, the request format for these wrappers may differ slightly to accommodate protocol-specific conventions and is pending further definition.

## 8\. Federation

Because the REST API is mandated, Registry-to-Registry routing (federation) becomes a simple HTTP operation. The client controls federation through the federation query parameter:

* **auto**: The Registry queries upstream registries automatically, merges their results with its own, and returns a unified response. The client gets a single merged result set.  
* **referrals**: The Registry returns its results plus catalog entries for other Registries the client may query. The client decides which to follow.  
* **none**: The Registry searches only its own index.

This gives the client full control over the federation topology without requiring complex protocol translation layers.

### Example: Referrals Mode

**Request:**

```
{
  "query": {
    "text": "find me a flight booking agent",
    "federation": "referrals"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:acme.com:agent:expense",
      "displayName": "Corporate Expenses",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://internal.corp/agents/expense.json",
      "score": 97,
      "source": "https://finder.internal.corp"
    }
  ],
  "referrals": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:blweb.ai:registry:public",
      "displayName": "Public Agent Finder",
      "type": "application/ai-registry",
      "url": "https://finder.nlweb.ai/search"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:example.com:registry:travel",
      "displayName": "Travel Agent Finder",
      "mediaType": "application/ai-registry",
      "url": "https://travel.finder.example/search"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 9\. Integration Example

A user asks an orchestrator: “Book me a flight to Tokyo and file the travel expense report.”

1. The orchestrator queries the enterprise Agent Registry with federation: "referrals".  
2. The Registry returns an internal expense agent, plus referrals to other Registries.  
3. The orchestrator follows a referral to a public Agent Registry and queries it for flight booking agents.  
4. The orchestrator now has both capabilities and can proceed to invoke them using their respective protocols (e.g., A2A for booking, MCP for expense filing).

---

## Appendix A: Filter Expression Syntax

The filter parameter in the Search API uses a simple EBNF-like format for structured constraints.

| Filter Field | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| displayName | String | Case-insensitive name filter. |
| type | String | Comma-separated media types (OR logic). |
| publisherId | String | Comma-separated publisher IDs (OR logic). |
| createdAfter | String | ISO 8601 timestamp. |
| updatedAfter | String | ISO 8601 timestamp. |

Logical AND is used across different parameters; OR is used within a single parameter with multiple values (comma-separated).

## Appendix B: Standard Error Codes

| HTTP Code | Error Code | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

## Appendix C: Agent Naming URN format {#appendix-c:-agent-naming-urn-format}

Restricting the discovery identifier to this specific URN format, rather than allowing arbitrary URIs (such as https://... or spiffe://...), provides fundamental architectural benefits for federated agent discovery:

1. **Nomenclature Stability (Immutable Noun vs. Mutable Location)**: Arbitrary URIs, particularly HTTP URLs, conflate the *logical identity* of a capability with its *physical network location*. If an enterprise migrates workloads across cloud providers, restructures its API gateway, or alters its deployment clusters, an HTTP URL breaks. The urn:ai: identifier acts as an abstract, permanent contract (the "noun"). Physical distribution and transport bindings are decoupled into the url or data fields, allowing underlying infrastructure to evolve without breaking client discovery, indexing, or orchestration code.  
2. **Strict Separation of Concerns**: Federated search registries require a clean, stable primary key to index capabilities efficiently across global networks. Conversely, zero-trust execution runtimes require dynamic, verifiable cryptographic tokens (SPIFFE IDs, DIDs, X.509 certificates) to authenticate workloads. Forcing a single URI to serve both roles creates an architectural bottleneck. The urn:ai: format cleanly decouples the searchable discovery handle from the security principal, allowing the discovery index and the security mesh to operate independently.  
3. **Decentralized Trust and Authority Binding**: In a globally federated open discovery network, search registries must prevent malicious actors from claiming namespaces they do not own (e.g., an untrusted publisher claiming urn:ai:google.com:tax-agent). Mandating that \<publisher\> be a valid FQDN establishes an immediate, verifiable authority anchor. Registries and orchestrators programmatically extract the domain from the URN (google.com) and cross-reference it with the cryptographic claim in trustManifest.identity. If the workload cannot produce a valid cryptographic attestation (e.g., mTLS certificate or SPIFFE SVID) issued by google.com, the capability is rejected. This ensures decentralized, zero-trust verification without requiring a centralized naming committee.  
4. **Search and Discovery Ergonomics (The @ Resolution Pattern)**: Users and LLMs require intuitive, semantic handles for capabilities (e.g., Assistant@Acme). The structured hierarchy of urn:ai:\<publisher\>:\<namespace\>:\<agent-name\> allows search engines and federated registries to parse components deterministically. Registries can easily match natural language queries to the publisher domain (Acme) and the terminal short name (Assistant), enabling high-performance semantic filtering, aggregation, and conflict resolution (e.g., displaying Assistant with a verified Acme shield).  
5. **Cross-Network Uniqueness and Federation Scalability**: Domain-anchored URNs guarantee global uniqueness across disparate federated registries without requiring centralized registration databases. Because domain names are already globally unique via the DNS root, anchoring the URN to a domain eliminates collision risks when merging catalogs from multiple upstream registries in auto or referrals federation modes.

## Appendix D: Formal Schema Definitions

To support automated validation, testing, and machine-readable compliance checking, this specification defines formal schemas for both the catalog metadata manifests and the Registry REST API. 

The schema specifications are provided across three distinct formats, serving different operational roles within the systems architecture:
1. **CDDL (Appendix D.1)**: The authoritative, abstract structural syntax definition. It provides an extremely concise, human-readable algebraic grammar optimized for formal IETF standards-track drafts, supporting both JSON and CBOR binary encodings natively.
2. **JSON Schema (Appendix D.2)**: The active web data validation schema, optimized for automated runtime client and server compliance checking in JSON-native development environments.
3. **OpenAPI (Appendix D.3)**: The REST endpoint specification, defining HTTP parameters, paths, status codes, and error schemas for integration with standard web gateways and client code-generators.

### D.1 The Authoritative CDDL Specification (RFC 8610)

The core data structures for the `ai-catalog.json` manifest, `CatalogEntry` models, zero-trust `trustManifest` security envelope, and Search Registry API payloads are formally specified using **Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL - RFC 8610)**. 

* **Authoritative Schema File**: [`spec/schemas/agentfinder.cddl`](schemas/agentfinder.cddl)

### D.2 The `ai-catalog.json` Manifest Schema (JSON Schema)

The JSON representation of the capability manifest hosted at `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` and individual catalog entries are formally defined using the **JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12)** standard. 

* **Authoritative Schema File**: [`spec/schemas/ai-catalog.schema.json`](schemas/ai-catalog.schema.json)
* **Key Validation Enforcements**:
  * Pattern matching URN compliance rules for the logical `identifier` format (`^urn:ai:...`).
  * Strict Value-or-Reference exclusion logic (`oneOf` matching either `url` or `data`, preventing duplicate definitions).
  * Struct checking for SPIFFE/DID compliance in `trustManifest` and `attestations` objects.

To validate local catalog manifest JSON files on a system using AJV CLI:
```bash
npx ajv-cli validate -s spec/schemas/ai-catalog.schema.json -d path/to/ai-catalog.json
```

### D.3 The Registry REST API Specification (OpenAPI)

The HTTP query interfaces (`POST /search` and `GET /agents`) exposed by compliant Agent Registries are formally defined using the **OpenAPI 3.1.0 Specification** in YAML.

* **Authoritative Specification File**: [`spec/schemas/openapi.yaml`](schemas/openapi.yaml)
* **Key Integration Benefits**:
  * Integrates paths, queries, status responses, and paging logic directly.
  * References the JSON Schema `ai-catalog.schema.json` schema files to ensure search and list return types are statically bound to the specification's schema constraints.
  * Allows automated router middleware enforcement and client/server stub generation (using tools like OpenAPI Generator).

### D.4 Official Conformance Testing Tool

To simplify development and guarantee complete compliance, this repository provides an official, zero-dependency **Conformance Testing CLI Tool** written in Python. It allows publishers to test their manifests and registry developers to validate their REST API servers.

* **Testing Tool Executable**: [`conformance/bin/conformance-test`](../conformance/bin/conformance-test)

#### Features:
* **Manifest validation mode**: Parses JSON manifests, runs strict JSON Schema checks (using the Python `jsonschema` library if installed), and executes custom semantic checks (e.g., URN formatting rules, Value-or-Reference enforcement, `representativeQueries` sizing).
* **Registry validation mode**: Probes live endpoints (`POST /search` and `GET /agents`), sends spec-compliant search requests, and validates status codes, pagination envelopes, search result scores, and catalog entry structures.

#### Usage Examples:

Validate a local or remote `ai-catalog.json` manifest:
```bash
# Validate a local catalog file
./conformance/bin/conformance-test manifest path/to/ai-catalog.json

# Validate a remote well-known catalog manifest
./conformance/bin/conformance-test manifest https://example.com/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
```

Validate a running Agent Registry REST API:
```bash
./conformance/bin/conformance-test registry http://localhost:9010/api
```

#### One-Click Conformance Demo

To instantly run a complete end-to-end verification suite utilizing a pre-bundled spec-compliant catalog manifest and a lightweight running mock Registry REST API server, run the automated demo script:
```bash
./conformance/bin/run-conformance-demo
```
This script performs manifest schema validation, launches a mock registry server in the background, executes live search and listing queries against it using the conformance tester, and gracefully terminates the server when finished.
